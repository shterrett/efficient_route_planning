# Efficient Route Planning

This repository is for work related to the [Efficient Route Planning
course](http://ad-wiki.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/EfficientRoutePlanningSS2012)
at the University of Freiburg. It is also the beginnings of learning
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org)

The `prep/` folder consists of self-imposed exercises completed before the start
of the course to help learn rust in a situation similar to what might be
experienced in the class.
